# Replit Tips

## Space Settings
Go to the `Settings` tab and change two things:  
**Indent type** = spaces  
**Indent size** = 4  
```{admonition} See Screenshot
:class: dropdown

```

These will make your code look easier to read and conform to all the template files provided to you.

## Auto-Formatting
`ctrl+s` : This will format your file according to the settings. Your code will have to be syntactically correct
in order for this to work.  

## Restart Project
Sometimes your project's configuration can get corrupt and it becomes too difficult to fix. It's time to start over! But, you don't need to recode everything. Instead:  
1) Download all your coded files.  
2) In the project's name dropdown, click the down arrow, click on the vertical dots, then select `Delete`.

## Restart Server
Sometimes the replit evironment may have the CPU or RAM pegged eventhough you're not doing anything.
To fix this, in the `shell` tab, run the command: `kill 1`
