# Line of Best Fit
in assignment that measured performance, I did work to find Mean Square Error

# seaborn regression

Can extend the x-axis and set regplot(truncate=False) to extend line out.

# ML regressions
https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/
https://datagy.io/mean-squared-error-python/
`model = LinearRegression()`

# SciPy & NumPy Regressions

This is a good way when using scatter plots. Seaborn doesn't seem to give the value when finding
the line of best fit.
