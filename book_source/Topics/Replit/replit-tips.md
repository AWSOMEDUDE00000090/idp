# Replit Tips

## Space Settings
Go to the `Settings` tab and change two things:  
**Indent type** = spaces  
**Indent size** = 4  
```{admonition} See Screenshot
:class: dropdown
![Set Spaces](../../_static/set_tabs.JPG)
```

These will make your code look easier to read and conform to all the template files provided to you.

## Auto-Formatting
`ctrl+s` : This will format your file according to the settings. Your code will have to be syntactically correct
in order for this to work. This will not adjust long comments to wrap accordingly.   

## Restart Project
Sometimes your project's configuration can get corrupt and it becomes too difficult to fix. It's time to start over! But, you don't need to recode everything. Instead:  
1) Download all your coded files.  
2) In the project's name dropdown, click the down arrow, click on the vertical dots, then select `Delete`.

3) Restart your project  
3) Drag your saved files into Replit  

## Restart Server
Sometimes the replit evironment may have the CPU or RAM pegged eventhough you're not doing anything.
To fix this, in the `shell` tab, run the command: `kill 1`
