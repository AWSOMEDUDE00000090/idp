# Tips for Final Report

Be terse and professional.
Don't represent the questions: present all the results in an "abstract."
Don't explain the methodology.
Present sources of data, but not details on the fields (unless that helps understand the results).
Don't speculate unless you have some kind of evidence or source that you cite.
You may have a speculation section about the results.
