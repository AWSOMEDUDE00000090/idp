# Replit Tips

## Space Settings
Go to the `Settings` tab and change two things:  
**Indent type** = spaces  
**Indent size** = 4  
```{admonition} See Screenshot
:class: dropdown
![Set Spaces](../../_static/set_tabs.JPG)
```

These will make your code look easier to read and conform to all the template files provided to you.

## Auto-Formatting
This appears to be broken. It used to work.  

`ctrl+s` : This will format your file according to the settings. Your code will have to be syntactically correct
in order for this to work. This will not adjust long comments to wrap accordingly.   

## Restart Server
Sometimes the replit evironment may have the CPU or RAM pegged even though you're not doing anything.
To fix this, in the `shell` tab, run the command: `kill 1`
