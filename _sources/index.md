# <i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles fa-fw"></i> Introduction

This website is intended to augment the [CSE 163: Intermediate Data Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163) curriculum and [online book](https://cse163.github.io/book) provided by Hunter Schafer. This UW course is completed in 10 weeks (the length of UW's quarter) while students in high school have 35 weeks, which means there is time for some _more stuff_. Furthermore, the tools leveraged and the expectations in the high school classroom are different, so some of the UW material published is simply inaccurate.
