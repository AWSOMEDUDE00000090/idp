# <i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles fa-fw"></i> Introduction

This website is intended to augment the [CSE 163: Intermediate Data Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163) curriculum and [online book](https://cse163.github.io/book) provided by Hunter Schafer. This UW course is completed in 10 weeks (the length of UW's quarter) while students in high school have 35 weeks, which means there is time for some _more stuff_. Furthermore, the tools leveraged and the expectations in the high school classroom are different, so some of the UW material published is simply inaccurate. 

Mr. Stride has created "this ridiculous" thing... for you.

Things this website hopes to have:
* NCHS Homework descriptions
* HW Tips and Tricks
* Machine Learning extras
* Plotting extras
* Final Project description and extras
* Cheatsheet Notes (maybe)
* Exam Preparation material (maybe)

Once you are ready to read, you can navigate the book using the sidebar on the left!  
  
Here are a bunch of TODOs for Mr. Stride:  
* Explain how an object can implement \_\_iter\_\_() and return a list of instance fields so that a caller can 'unpack' the object into a set of fields. Note that list object is iterable and can also be unpacked. It doesn't have to be a tuple.  
* Add cross-referencing across the topics so that when an example method uses something advanced, then that can be further discussed in another page/topic.  
* Generators (and recursion in a generator... ouch!)  
* walrus operator  
* decorators: @staticmethod, @classmethod  
* interfaces (how are they different from classes)  
* decorators as found here: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/decorator  
* closures and nested methods  
* Dictionary comprehensions  
* map, filter, reduce,  
* a summary of good built-in python functions: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html   
* Math to reverse randomized response   
* 5 stages of research (gather, organize, report, conclude, act or enact policy)
* confirmation bias  (other biases?)   
* "stuff" in my Notes directory   
* flake8 rules to ignore  (or that I hate)  
* prosecutors falacy, simpson's paradox, (other things from good videos)  
* commenting  
    * tabs for: Too Little, Goldilocks, Too Much  
    * prototype explains WHAT  
    * inline value, especially WHY  
* When do figures get reset in Replit (when do we need to do plt.cla() to clear current active axis, plt.clf() to clear entire current figure).  
* plt.gca() gets the current axis. So there is a concept of the current figure and current axis. plt.gcf() gets the current figure. 
* Explain: figure, axis, grid, markers, ticks, labels, title (suptitle, too), spines. Naming convensions. ( axis.set_{name} where plot.{name})  
* Explain: when to use:
    * ser.plot()  
    * df.plot()  
    * sns.lineplot()  
    * plt.plot()  
    * ax.plot()
