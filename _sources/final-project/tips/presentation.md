# Tips for Final Presentation

The final presentation should highlight your discoveries, both expected and unexpected.There are a few key ideas you should cover.
* Title and Authors
* Underlying Motivation
* Articulation of Research Inquiries
* Results, visualizations, and key takeaways
* Future work, or future directions for this project

To expand beyond what is provided, you need to find a creative and valuable addition to incorporate in your project to make it unique and for it to synthesize. Here are a few of the **many** approaches you can take to run the extra mile.

# Approach 1: Change in research questions over time. 

In conducting research, the formulation of a research question is a crucial step that evolves over time. As researchers delve deeper into the subject matter, gain new insights, and adapt to changing circumstances, the initial research question may undergo modifications or even a complete transformation. Changes can occur due to many reasons such as:
1. Pilot Study or Data Collection
2. Data Analysis and Initial Findings
3. Feedback and Peer Review

By explaining how your research changed as you gained a better understanding of your topic can provide insightful information to the audiance. It also adds layers and nuances to your final presentation. 

# Approach 2: Research questions focusing on different demographics

Having multiple research questions that focus on different areas or demographics within a project can enhance the depth and breadth of your study. Here's a description of how to accomplish this and a specific example to illustrate the concept:

To create multiple research questions focusing on different areas or demographics, you should first identify the key dimensions they wish to explore within the broader research topic. These dimensions could be distinct variables, subgroups, or specific factors of interest. Each research question should be clear, relevant, and aligned with the unique characteristics of the subgroup or area under investigation.

**Example:**
Let's consider a research project examining the incidents in aerospace technology. 
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Research Questions
1. How does the number and rate of aviation accidents correlate with different aspects of the temporal dimension (technological progression)?
2. What is the relationship between aircraft mechanical factors and the likelihood of aviation accidents?
3. How do external environmental factors such as geographical patterns and weather conditions correlate with the occurrence of aviation accidents?
4. What is the role of human factors, including communication, crew-related factors, and staffing levels, in aviation accidents and incidents?
5. To what extent can machine learning extract factorial information from personal narratives of aviation accidents? 
```
```{tab-item} Comments
In this example, the researchers have formulated five distinct research questions, each focusing on a different area and demographic. By having multiple research questions, the researchers can collect data specifically tailored to each potential hazard in aerospace engineering as well as factors of ML.

The first two focus on aircraft accidents and their connection to technology. The third question covers envionrmental and geographical demographics. The fourth is centered towards human behavior and physcology. And lastly, the fifth questions aims to draw connections using a Machine Learning model. 

The different perspectives covered in this research, enviornmental, technology, physcological, and more make it complex and incredibly insightful. It also sets up the stage for conversation between findings.

# Approach 3: Conversation between findings and takeaways. 

Do they support each other? Or contradict each other?

Once you have created your visualizations, machine learning model, or any other means of extracting information from your data, your task now is to have them communicate with each other. 

**Example:**
In the study of alcohol abuse and related factors in the United States, the following information was extracted by various datasets:
1. Visualizations
2. Regression ML Model error 
3. Analysis on the ML Decision Tree
4. Feature Importance 

One commonality between all of the information was that they supported that income levels can affect the rates of alcohol abuse. Highlighting these connections in your presentation can help connect fragmented parts of your research and build a deeper connection overall.
