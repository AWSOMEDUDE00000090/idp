# Geospatial Plots

Here are great geospatial plots


# Future Work
Question: Can the annotation code method be used to annotate a geospatial plot?  
Question: Can we manually relocate Alaska and Hawaii in the geometry space to fake a small Alaska?  Also, draw a box around them.  
(Note that Krithika also had a Correlation Heat Map)
(Ria had Exhibit of geospatial that looks to be "stolen" from somewhere, but looks good!)
