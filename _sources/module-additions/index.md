# <i class="fas fa-layer-group fa-fw"></i> Module Additions

This section will provide extra instructional information useful to your success.
The content does NOT replace what is found on [CSE 163](https://cse163.github.io/book/). Instead, the content
in these Modules mirrors the same structure while providing extra information. For example, you'll
find helpful tips on how to execute the correct python file in your `replit` projects, or how to
reset the remote Replit server to recover spinning CPU cycles. 

You'll find material on formatted print statements and variable arguments with more detailed
explanations of unpacking. You can find a wider variety of effective plots commonly used in the
final project and the code used to generate them.
