# Replit Tips

## Space Settings
Go to the `Settings` tab and change two things:  
**Indent type** = spaces  
**Indent size** = 4  
![Set Spaces](../../_static/mod_imgs/set_tabs.jpg)

These will make your code look easier to read and conform to all the template files provided to you.

## Auto-Formatting
`ctrl+s` : This will format your file according to the settings. Your code will have to be syntactically correct
in order for this to work.  

## Restart 
Sometimes the replit evironment may have the CPU or RAM pegged eventhough you're not doing anything.
To fix this, in the `shell` tab, run the command: `kill 1`
