# Replit Tips

## Space Settings
Go to the `Settings` tab and change two things:  
**Indent type** = spaces  
**Indent size** = 4  

These will make your code look easier to read and conform to all the template files provided to you.

## Auto-Formatting
`ctrl+s` : This will format your file according to the settings. Your code will have to be syntactically correct
in order for this to work.
